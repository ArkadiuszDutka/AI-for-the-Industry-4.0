AI for the Industry 4.0

This project is a data analysis and machine learning project that aims to classify substances based on sensor readings.

Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need to install Python 3.x and the following Python packages:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
    
Data

The data for this project is located in the "data" folder. It consists of three sensor readings for three different substances: air, izopropanol, and water. Each sensor reading contains a timestamp and a signal value.

Analysis

The analysis for this project consists of the following steps:

Data preprocessing: The data is loaded and preprocessed to remove any unnecessary information and ensure that the data is in the correct format.

Data visualization: The data is visualized using Matplotlib to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns.

Fourier transform: The Fourier transform is used to convert the time domain data into the frequency domain. This allows us to identify any specific frequencies that are present in the data.

Linear regression: Linear regression is used to fit a line to the data and identify any relationships between the timestamp and signal value.
